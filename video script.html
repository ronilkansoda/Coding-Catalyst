            <p><strong>Transcript:</strong> In today's video, we will see functions in JavaScript.

                We use functions in JavaScript to 
                organize our code.
                
                There are certain code blocks that 
                may require repeated copying.
                
                And in this case, we want to separate 
                that logic.
                
                Here, functions in JavaScript perform the 
                task of separation of logic in this case.
                
                And we can put different parameters
                (which are the inputs of the function)
                
                and by applying such functions that, 
                we can get different results
                
                For example, we can write a function
                that will find out the average of number 4.
                
                We can apply those 4 numbers in different ways
                
                and get different outputs from that function.
                
                So, you can say it as function is a black box
                that takes input
                
                and gives the output analyzing that input.
                
                This makes the process easier for the programmer
                
                Because he can treat the function as a black box 
                if the function is written by someone else.
                
                You guys donâ€™t be confused.
                Because we are moving on to the computer screen
                
                to see the basics of function and we 
                will see how to write the functions.
                
                Let's move on to the computer screen.
                Let's get started.
                
                So, guys today we are going to talk about functions.
                
                we will learn about functions.
